### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I always wanted to create a date
    difference calculator that could calculate how long the days are left
    till for example, my next birthday. I was able to write a function for
    the first time that calculated dates expected based on Gregorian calendar. 
    
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because it was amazing to see how
    the code I wrote created an ASCII art that was so creative.
    I used the member function get() and repeated it while loop 
    to dislpay the characters which displays the animation. 
    
* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because it was entertaining 
    for me to create a game that gives players a limited number
    of guesses to guess the secret number. I was able to write 
    a code that loops until the game ends while prompting users
    the number 1 to 10.
